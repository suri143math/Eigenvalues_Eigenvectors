# Eigenvalues_Eigenvectors
Study of Eigen values and eigen vectors


Please edit the code such that the result has to be printed as follows:

1. the determinant is ------------

2. a) If the determinant is not equal to 0, then print the solution
   b) If the determinant is equal to 0, then print No solution/many solutions

3. a) Eigen values are -------
   b) Eigen vectors are -------
